# Machine-Learning-Algorithm-for-Voice-Analysis
It is an algorithm analysed the acoustic features of a voice and creates an acoustic classifier - USEFUL for auto-speech-rater

It takes 12 hours to complete the machine training (12000 datapoints and 47 initial features).
To run the algorithm, you need to prepare your dataset in the form of csv.
If you need the algorithm to extract the acoustic features of audios, please contact me https://shahabks.github.io/Mysolution-Lab-AI/
